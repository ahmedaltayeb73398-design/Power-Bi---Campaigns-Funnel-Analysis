 Funnel analysis of marketing campaign paths for only 3 stages
 
## 📌 Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the marketing funnel performance for five distinct campaigns: Outdoor Billboard, Summer Sales, Winter Clearance, Ramadan Promo, and Eid Celebration. The analysis tracks the customer journey from the initial Impressions stage, through Clicks, to the final Conversions, evaluating the ROI and efficiency of each marketing channel.

## ❓ Core Analytical Question
"Which marketing campaign demonstrated the highest efficiency in converting prospects into customers, and where do the primary drop-off points occur within the sales funnel for each campaign?"

## 🔍 Key Insights
